# neurosymbolic-legal-reasoner

A neuro-symbolic reasoning framework for explainable legal inference based on symbolic knowledge and rule-based reasoning.

## Overview

This project explores a **neuro-symbolic approach to legal reasoning**, where symbolic knowledge representations and logical inference mechanisms form the core reasoning engine, while neural components are used only for language understanding and query mapping.

The system is designed to support:
- Forward and backward reasoning
- Verification of conclusions based on legal conditions
- Detection of contradictions and missing conditions
- Generation of reasoning traces for explainability

Although the initial use case focuses on legal reasoning, the framework is designed to be domain-agnostic.

## Key Ideas

- **Symbolic knowledge** represented as ontology, facts, and rules
- **Rule-based inference** for forward and backward reasoning
- **Explainable reasoning**, where conclusions are accompanied by explicit justification
- **Neural components as support**, not as black-box decision makers

## Scope

This project does **not** aim to:
- Perform end-to-end neural reasoning
- Learn rules automatically from large datasets
- Optimize predictive accuracy as a primary objective

Instead, the focus is on **logical correctness, verification, and interpretability**.
